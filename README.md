# RandomMuzakGenerator

## An experimental program for writing muzak.

I began this project as an Object Oriented Design challenge to see how intuitively I could represent a song (or really just a long sequence of chords and notes played in time and key) in code. Eventually, I hope to get this group of classes to a point where they can manipulate music data in a very useful way.

### Setup:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run with:
```
$ python main.py
```

#### To play:
* Some type of DAW or media player that can play midi files. (Files will be saved in the root directory after execution)
