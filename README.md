# RandomMuzakGenerator

## An experimental program for writing muzak.

I began this project as an Object Oriented Design challenge to see how intuitively I could represent a song (or really just a long sequence of chords and notes played in time and key) in code. Eventually, I hope to get this group of classes to a point where they can manipulate music data in a very useful way.

### Requirements
#### To run:
* [MIDIUtil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MIDIUtil) *python library for creating multi-track MIDI files* 

#### To play:
* Some type of DAW or media player that can play midi files. (Files will be saved in the root directory after execution)
